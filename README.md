# crud-application

1. I did receive some help from classmates, such as Katrina Saulon and Abhishek Joshi as well as Mike Freeman and various others in the TE lab.
2. I did not.
3. This assignment took me a very long time, approximately 10 hours
4. I feel this assignment was not a fair representation of the skills we had learned in class as this assignment was much more difficult than in class exercises. For the future, I would suggest that this assignment be a group assignment.
